                    History</h2>
                <p> On 19th May 1975 the foundation stone was laid by the then vice president of the republic of Kenya
                    H.E Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi, upon invitation by the then area Mp Hon. Jean Marie Seroney. The
                    school land was donated by Tapengelei Farmers Company limited. The school board of management at
                    that time was:
                     Charman –Samwel Chelule.
                     Secretary-Samwel Letting.
                     Treasurer-Kiptarus Cheruiyot.
                    In 1979, Hon Taita Towett the minister for education official opened the school and held the
                    fundraising with the late Mrs. Abura. In 1981, Hon Henry Kosgey, the minster for transport and
                    communication became the first B.O.M Chairman. During tenure, he help build Kosgey domitory and
                    Abura dormitory with the help of Mrs Abura and Barng’entuny dormitory, even after his tenure of
                    office, his support through the CDF funds has seen two projects that is Kiptarus dormitory and the
                    flash toilets in the tuition area completed and the third CDF project is in progress, the current
                    phase four tuition block.
                    In 1998, Hon Joseph Letting the then head of public Service became the B.O.M chairman. He supported
                    the construction of eight units of teacher’s houses, Tendenei dormitory, installation of the power
                    in the school and partly the contraction of the Dining Hall. The third B.O.M chairman from the year
                    2000 was the late Dr Peter Biwott whose tenure in office saw the completion of the dining hall and
                    the kitchen. Mr. Paul Lilan our current B.O.M chairman took over from the year 2004. With his
                    support four classrooms have been put up using the infrastructure fun from the Government of Kenya.
                    We have also seen the completion of the flush toilets around the tuition area, the construction of
                    Kipratus dormitory and the ongoing construction of phase four tuition block, all this is through the
                    C.D.F funds. The new dormitory Ng’orbobit was put up using the P.T.A funds. We have also put up a
                    dairy farm with a capacity of seven cows, a fish pond founded by the ministry of Agriculture and a
                    biogas plant founded by the Forestry department amongst other projects.

                the career paths of the students right from the subject selection to choices of courses to peruse in the
                university The vision shared with the academics department since a career path a student chooses is what
                powers his academics thus a common goal of achieving good results which culminate into success in
                totality.Life is laden with questions everyone has a question or two about something in life; why how
                where what and who? These are question every human being has asked and will continue to ask , several
                times. Some time there are answers sometimes not, until we are wearied and frustrated to exasperation
                and we resign. In this aspect the department organizes career guidance consists of the services that
                help students successfully manage their career development. Al though this aspect of human development
                occurs own its own as we mature everybody can benefit through assistance and navigate through the
                process.</P>
