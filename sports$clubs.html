                <p>The school has got the chaplaincy program to help boost the ethos in support of the administration.
                    Just to put it in a nut shell, chaplaincy provides pastoral care in a way which complements what is
                    being provided by other members of staff. Chaplain could often be seen as a bridge to activate
                    community building in a wider sense for the benefit of the school. Therefore chaplain does not have
                    disciplinary responsibility but could listen to issues none judgmentally.
                    The chaplain runs needs-based programs such as handling of grief or behavioral management. He also
                    leads during the school events or special ceremonies and participates in school camps for the
                    youths. Similarly the chaplains department provides guidance to students on issues concerning human
                    relationships and by extension does off-site visits to parents and care givers. On Sunday’s all
                    students pray together in the services irrespective of their religious background. The school
                    provides spiritual aspect of every individual and factoring in God’s word in their programs.

                    The role of sports in school cannot be underscored. It goes with to adage; all work with no play
                    makes Jack a dull boy. As such Meteitei boys offers magnificent opportunities for sporting
                    activities .This is tandem with the national goal of education. The school offers volleyball,
                    football, handball, table tennis, rugby, hockey athletics, basketball and badminton and law tennis.
                    The school has begun the journey in reclaiming its glory as a sport powerhouse. We have proved
                    indomitable over the years and the years 2016 was great considering that our hockey team played
                    final at the county despite of the challenge of lack of playing field for practice .Badminton also
                    did us proud by winning the county trophy and representing Nandi county in the regional completion.
                    With our unweaving faith in our abilities we hope to reach National completions. Acknowledging the
                    giants of the valley the school administration offers the teams and their coaches utmost support
                    such us, facilitating tournament, training of couches and supply of games equipments.
